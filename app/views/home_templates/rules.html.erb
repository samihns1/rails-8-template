    <h1>Basra — Game Rules</h1>
    <p class="basra-rules-intro">
      Basra is a fast-paced card-capturing game played with a standard 52-card deck.
      It supports 2 to 4 players and continues until one player reaches 180 points.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Setup</h2>

  <h3>Players</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Basra can be played by 2, 3, or 4 players.</li>
    <li>Play proceeds clockwise.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Dealing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A player is randomly selected to go first. Turn order stays the same for the entire game.</li>
    <li>Deal 4 cards to each player.</li>
    <li>Place 4 cards face-up on the table.</li>
    <li>
      If any of the table cards are the <strong>7 of Diamonds</strong>
      <span class="suit-tag">7♦</span>
      or <strong>a Jack</strong>, return them to the deck and replace them.
    </li>
    <li>When all players run out of cards, deal another 4 cards each until the deck is fully used.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Gameplay</h2>

  <h3>Turn Order</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The selected starting player plays first.</li>
    <li>Turns rotate clockwise.</li>
    <li>There is no passing. Each player must play exactly one card on their turn.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Capturing Cards</h3>
  <p>When you play a card onto the table, you may capture cards according to these rules:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Same Value Capture:</strong>
      If the table contains a card of the same rank, capture both cards.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Sum Capture:</strong>
      If the table contains cards whose total value equals the rank of the played card,
      capture all cards in that matching combination.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Both Conditions:</strong>
      If both the same-rank card and a valid sum combination exist, capture all of them.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Kings and Queens:</strong>
      These have no numerical value and can only be captured by another card of the same rank.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Jacks:</strong>
      Any Jack captures all cards on the table.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Seven of Diamonds (7♦):</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the sum of all table cards equals 7, <em>or</em> if there is exactly one card on the table,
          the 7♦ captures all cards and counts as a Basra.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, it acts like a Jack and captures all cards, but it does not count as a Basra.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Basra</h2>
  <p>A Basra is worth 10 points. A Basra occurs when:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Clean Sweep With a Non-Jack Card:</strong>
      You play a card (not a Jack or the 7♦) that captures every card on the table in one move,
      leaving the table blank.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Seven of Diamonds Basra:</strong>
      The 7♦ captures every card and the total table value was 7 or there was exactly one card on the table.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Last Capture:</strong>
      After the final card is played, the last player to make a capture takes all remaining table cards.
      (This is not a Basra.)
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Scoring</h2>

  <h3>Card Majority</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If a player captures 27 or more cards (majority of cards if playing with more than 2 players),
      they score 30 points.
    </li>
    <li>If two players tie at 26 cards each, no points are awarded.</li>
    <li>
      The 30 points roll over into the next round, making that round worth 60 points if the tie repeats.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Basra Points</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Each Basra is worth 10 points.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Winning the Game</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The game continues until one player reaches 180 points.</li>
    <li>That player is declared the winner.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="basra-note">
    Tip: Keep an eye on the table total and Jacks in hand — timing your Basra can swing an entire round.
